career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm a PhD student at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), who's keen on system and circuit neuroscience. 
      I'm trying to understand the dynamical interactions among cortical-subcortical regions during motor timing in mice,
      with large-scale electrophysiology, optogenetics and computational analysis.   
education:
