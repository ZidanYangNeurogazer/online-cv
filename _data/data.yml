career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm a PhD student at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), who's keen on system and circuit neuroscience. 
      I'm trying to understand the dynamical interactions among cortical-subcortical regions during motor timing in mice,
      with large-scale electrophysiology, optogenetics and computational analysis.

        details: |
          Brain regions work together to plan when and how before executing trained movements, by measuring multiple regions' activities
          simultaneously with Neuropixels probe, and interrogating their causal relationships with fine-scale optogentics, I'm trying to 
          untangle the system mecahnism underlying motor timing.
