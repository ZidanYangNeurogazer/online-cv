career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm a PhD student at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), who's keen on system and circuit neuroscience. 
      I'm trying to understand the dynamical interactions among cortical-subcortical regions during motor timing in mice,
      with large-scale electrophysiology, optogenetics and computational analysis.

          Brain regions work together to plan when and how before executing trained movements, by measuring multiple regions' activities
          simultaneously with Neuropixels probe, and interrogating their causal relationships with fine-scale optogentics, I'm trying to 
          untangle the system mecahnism underlying motor timing.
